Marilyn Monroe stated that she was going to set up a press conference and tell the public what Jack Kennedy had told her regarding objects from outer space that had crashed and been retrieved in New Mexico in the 1940\\'s! President Kennedy had confided this information to her, because he had seen the ET craft and debris from the UFO crash there. This still-top-secret document is dated the day before the night they found Marilyn Monroe dead. I\\'ve also located someone who was with the Los Angeles Police Department intelligence unit that helped facilitate the wiretapping and monitoring of her up to the time of her death and actually knew how they killed Marilyn Monroe. There is no doubt that she was murdered by cut-out agents of the US intelligence community...
